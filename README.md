1. a function to be plotted [(Number -> Number)]
2. x-min [Number]
3. x-max [Number]
4. y-min [Number]
5. y-max [Number]

xy-plot-cont
------------

This function plots a graph. It is very fast. However,
it assumes that the plotting graph is continuous and therefore will show
stange behavior such as showing vertical bars in a step function

Arguments are:

1. a function to be plotted [(Number -> Number)]
2. x-min [Number]
3. x-max [Number]
4. y-min [Number]
5. y-max [Number]
