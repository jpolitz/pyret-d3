Issues
======

xy-plot
-------

1. What will happen if we try to plot "lam(x): (num-sqr(x) - 4) / (x - 2) end"?
Should it make an error when encounter x = 2?

2. Each window creates a lot of objects which is not destroyed when it is closed

3. Bignum? Irrational Number? Complex Number? How should we deal with these?
